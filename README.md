# Back2Nokia – A Fun Learning Snake Game for Kids

## Project Overview
Back2Nokia is an educational version of the classic Nokia Snake game designed especially for children. It combines nostalgia with learning, where the snake eats not just food items, but also educational elements such as numbers, alphabets, and multiplication tables.

The game includes:
- User login system
- Personalized leaderboard
- Score tracking based on correct selections
- Random sequence game mode (Eat 1 → 2 → 3 → ...)
- Database-based progress storage

---

## Problem Statement
Old keypad phones and their iconic games have almost disappeared. The challenge is to bring this concept back in a new, meaningful, and engaging way for today’s generation.

---

## Proposed Solution
We create a learning-based Snake game where children learn while playing:
- Snake eats the next correct number or item
- Score increases for correct items
- Score decreases for wrong items
- Progress is saved using a backend database
- Tables (2–10) and alphabet learning can be added as modes

This approach revives a classic game while turning it into a learning tool.
